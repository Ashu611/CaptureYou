# CaptureYou
A Java based program which authenticates and captures the image of the person trying to intrude into your device.
It is a application which has the ability to capture the image of the person trying login into your device.
It is built in Java and acts as a secondary authentication application which overlays the screen and prevents invalid user to get into you device until and unless he logs in here with the proper credentials.
This project is in progress and can require little more time.
But hopefully it will get completed soon.

Steps for installation are :
1. Clone the project using " git clone " command.
2. Place the folder in your IDE project folder. For e.g. if netbeans is what you use, then Netbeans Projects is where you will keep this folder.
3. Locate src >> LoginCapture.java.
4. Create a hash value of the password you want to keep as a authentication password of the CaptureYou application using hashgenerator.java situated in "/dist".
5. Copy the generated hash value.
6. Open your Java IDE for e.g. Netbeans, locate file LoginCapture.java locate the predefined hash value of the password there.
7. Paste your manually generated hash value of your password there and build the project again.
